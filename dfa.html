                        DFA @ UCSD is a student-led design organization whose studio has operated on campus since 2016. 
                        Members help the San Diego community by engineering  human centered design solutions. Each quarter 
                        DFA recruits a line up of non-profit organizations that they can work with throughout the school year.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Trying to find the motivation to work on projects to build your design portfolio can be tiring. 
                        Balancing that with school is difficult and if you have a heavy workload and your design work is 
                        not particularly inspiring, it can be all the more frustrating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An activity through your school to 
                        bridge the gap between the academic world and the working world can make the transition into the 
                        workforce go much more smoothly. If you are applying yourself in projects you are passionate about 
                        and make you feel like you are doing something positive in your community, the workload you are 
                        undertaking can feel much more manageable.

                        the information they are looking for.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        John was highly active in his high school’s Key Club, where he designed various marketing material for 
                        his club. John had always been in touch with his creative side, but only began to seriously consider a 
                        career in UX Design after taking DSGN 1 his freshman year. In an effort to get involved, John joined 
                        several Facebook groups where he recently came across Design for America (DFA). He firmly believes that 
                        DFA compliments his interests as they combine both her love for community service and passion for design.
                    </p>
                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        John needs an easy way to access DFA links from social media posts, background about what DFA is and what 
                        they do, and to be able to quickly navigate to previous and current projects. He wants to be a member of DFA 
                        and make friends with others in his major and to find an organization he knows will provide real world experience.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Lauren was born and riased in Point Loma. She became interested in community service after volunteering at 
                        Feeding San Diego as a high schooler and came back to the organization as an employee. She has had a positive 
                        experience working with student volunteers and appreciates their "outside the box" perspective. DFA recently 
                        reached out to her and she is requesting their help to promote Feeding San Diego’s Semi-Annual Food Drive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She needs to discover who DFA is and what they do, evaluate DFA past projects, get a feel for their credibility,
                        get an understanding of DFA’s timeline and the time commitment, and find relevant contact information. She hopes 
                        to gain traction through improved design, find new and novel techniques for improving their operations, and help 
                        college students grow in their design skills by providing them with real-world work experience.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Through our user testing, we found that the navigation of information in the “Get Involved” section was not intuitive. 
                        The application was hidden under the Apply to DFA link, which looked like a header instead of a link. It seemed more 
                        obvious to click on the “More information” button, however that navigated to a slide deck on google slides, not an application.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        For our redesign, we chose to host all of the information in one place to avoid clicking through pages to find 
                        information. The “Apply Now” button was emphasized on the first page and the link to the additional information 
                        slides was made secondary in the hierarchy.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        In our original design, we had a small drop down menu next to the project title. This feature was made very 
                        small and was often overlooked. It made navigation between projects not as clear as it should be.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        In our redesign, we chose to create a scrollable carousel with each project’s page. We found that 
                        including the arrows on the side and and page indicating dots on the bottom made this method of 
                        navigation much more obvious.

                    <h5>My Biggest <span>Takeaways</span></h5>
                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        One of the aspects of this project that I found most surprising was managing the differences between what was 
                        being asked of us by the class and our client. This is not too difficult, however the difference of attitude 
                        towards a project between the teaching staff and your client is something that you might need to think about.
                    </p>
                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Especially because we worked on an informational website, it was pretty difficult to design a mobile first 
                        website. Our client was emphasizing a desktop-first approach, but our professor stressed a mobile-first strategy. 
                        Fitting a lot of information onto a small phone screen in a way that looks good is more difficult than I 
                        anticipated. There needs to be much more thought, planning and iteration.
