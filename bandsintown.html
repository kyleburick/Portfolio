                        Bandsintown was created to strengthen the bond between fans and their favorite music 
                        artists by simplifying the discovery of upcoming concerts. This valuable relationship 
                        between new artist discovery and fan acquisition is created by features that emphasize 
                        continuous  connection, artist visibility, and direct communication. We decided to 
                        evaluate Bandsintown as it’s core mission is very valuable to avid music listeners who 
                        frequently miss out on shows they’d otherwise love to see. In the aftermath of COVID-19 
                        people are more excited about getting out to live shows than ever before.

                        Finding information about your favorite and new artists can feel a bit disconnected. 
                        You might discover new artists through different social media platforms, buy merch and 
                        find tour dates on their personal website, and buy tickets through the venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be so much easier if all of this functionality was housed in one location. 
                        Suppose a potential new fan discovers a new artist on social media, only to become 
                        confused about tour dates and where to find current information about the band. These 
                        small inconveniences can be the difference between a loyal, lifelong fan and an 
                        someone who leaves the website discouraged.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Through our user testing, we found that users were confused as to how to use the "Browse by Artist" page to 
                        add new artists. They thought that to search for a new artist, they would go to this page, but there is no 
                        search bar. You can only be given recommended artists, and there is no way to filter your results. You are just 
                        given a random assortment of faceless artist names. They were both unable to search for new artists and unable 
                        to tell what kinds of random artists they were being recommended.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        For our redesign, we chose to create an explore section that is more intuitive for the users. The original 
                        version had users guessing where to go to search for new artists. The ambiguously named section called 
                        "Browse by Artist" no longer draws them in and there is a clear search bar labeled "Explore" that has an 
                        obvoius search filter icon next to it, giving users a clear path to find new artists in a geanre that 
                        they enjoy.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        We found that users were having a very difficult time locating the artists that they were currently following. 
                        The "Browse by Artist" section seemed to them like a place where you would go to find new artists, but that is 
                        where most of our users ended up eventually finding the artists that they follow. The default view of the page 
                        has the slider at the top set to recommended, so they are being given a selection of random artists along with 
                        the ones that they follow. They were confused how to set it to just show the artists that they follow because 
                        the bar at the top appears to be a continuous slider bar, but it operates as a switch.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        The majority of our users said that they would be using this app primarily to follow artists they like to be 
                        able to easily tell when they are playing shows in their area. This is why it is so important that we make it 
                        clear where you can go to see your artists. The redesign that we implemented makes it clear that there is a 
                        section for "Your Artists" instead of one section called "Browse by Artist" that our users found to be very 
                        ambiguous. We also made sure that the artists being shown had visual elements to them instead of the original 
                        version that only showed your followed artists as faceless names.

                        This prototype allowed for much more ease of access to different sections of the page due to 
                        the addition of horizontal and vertical scrolling. The added negative space made it much 
                        more approachable to new users as well. You also have the ability to browse by genres and 
                        set your location, but you can also browse by your favorite artists or emerging artists. 
                        This gives you quick access to your favorite musicians and makes it very easy to explore 
                        new ones. However, it lacks the customizability to create a custom feed where you can have 
                        a blend of updates from artists, new recommendations, and shows in your area, allowing you 
                        to truly explore. Additionally, it lacks the ability to select the specific date you want 
                        to find shows for.
