                        Bandsintown was created to strengthen the bond between fans and their favorite 
                        music artists by simplifying the discovery of upcoming concerts. This valuable 
                        relationship between new artist discovery and fan acquisition is created by 
                        features that emphasize continuous connection, artist visibility, and direct 
                        communication. We decided to evaluate Bandsintown, looking at its success in 
                        achieving its core mission of serving as a valuable tool to help avid music 
                        listeners who frequently miss out on shows they’d otherwise love to see.

                        Finding information about your favorite artists and discovering new artists can 
                        feel a bit disconnected. You might discover new artists through different social 
                        media platforms, buy merch and find tour dates on their personal website, and buy 
                        tickets through the concert venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be so much easier if all of this functionality was housed in one location. 
                        Suppose a potential new fan discovers a new artist on social media, only to become 
                        confused about tour dates and where to find current information about the band. 
                        These small inconveniences can be the difference between a loyal, lifelong fan, 
                        and an someone who leaves the website discouraged.

                        now cost 3x the original price.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        Through our user testing, we found that users were confused about how to use the 
                        "Browse by Artist" page to add new artists. They thought that to search for a new 
                        artist, they would go to this page, but this page had no search bar. Instead, this 
                        page only gave them recommended artists, without a way to filter results. The user 
                        is just given a random assortment of faceless artist names. They were both unable 
                        to search for new artists and unable to determine what kinds of random artists the 
                        app was recommending.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        For our redesign, we chose to eliminate the confusing “Browse by Artist” section 
                        in favor of a new “Explore” section that is more intuitive for the users. The 
                        original version had users guessing where to go to search for new artists. The 
                        ambiguously named section, called "Browse by Artist," no longer draws them in and 
                        there is a clear search bar labeled "Explore" that has an obvoius search filter 
                        icon next to it, giving users a clear path to find new artists in a genre that they 
                        enjoy.

                    <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                    <h5>Where Our Users Experienced <span>Problems</span></h5>
                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        We found that users were having a very difficult time locating the artists that they 
                        were currently following. The "Browse by Artist" section seemed to them like the place 
                        to go to find new artists and shows. The default view of the “Browse by Artist” page 
                        has the slider at the top, set to recommended, so the user is being given a selection 
                        of random artists along with the ones that the user follows. The users were confused 
                        how to set the app to just show the artists that they follow because the bar at the 
                        top appears to be a continuous slider bar, but it operates as a switch.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        The user research data showed that the majority of the users said that they would be 
                        using this app primarily to follow artists they liked in order to be notified of local 
                        shows for these artists in their area. This is why it is so important that we make it 
                        clear where the user can go to see favorite artists. The redesign that we implemented 
                        adds a section for "Your Artists" instead of the ambiguous "Browse by Artist" section. 
                        We also made sure that each displayed artist had identifying visual elements instead of 
                        the faceless names for followed artists in the original version.

                    <p id="dfa-background">
                        The redesigned prototype allowed for greater ease of access to different sections of 
                        the page with the addition of horizontal and vertical scrolling. The added negative 
                        space made the app much more approachable to new users as well. A users now also has 
                        the ability to browse by genres and set a location, and the user can also browse by 
                        favorite artists or emerging artists. This gives the user quick access to favorite 
                        musicians and makes it very easy to explore new ones. However, it needs additional 
                        work as it still lacks the customizability to create a custom feed where the user 
                        can have a blend of information, including updates from artists, new recommendations, 
                        and shows in the user’s area, allowing a user to truly explore. Additionally, it 
                        still lacks the ability to search for shows by a specific date.
